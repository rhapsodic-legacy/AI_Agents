# Agents
## From First Steps to Advanced Use Cases 

### Purpose
This repository is designed for university students learning to build AI agents using **LangChain**, a powerful Python framework for creating intelligent agents. The goal is to guide students from their **first simple agent** to **advanced agentic use cases**, such as task automation, web scraping, data analysis, and more. Each agent in this series builds on the previous one, introducing new concepts, tools, and real-world applications in a student-friendly, hands-on way. 

Whether you're a beginner or advancing toward complex projects, this repo provides code, tutorials, and insights to help you master AI agent development.

### Contents
The repository currently includes two folders, with more to be added as the series expands:

- **A_Langchain_Simple**: The starting point for your AI agent journey.
  - `first_agent.ipynb`: A Google Colab notebook containing a simple but functional AI agent built with LangChain and Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Flash (free tier). This agent uses a calculator tool to solve math queries, like "What is 5 + 3 * 2?".
  - `building_your_first_agent.txt`: A detailed, student-friendly tutorial covering:
    - What an AI agent is.
    - How to set up your environment and obtain a Gemini API key.
    - A step-by-step walkthrough of the agent code.
    - Tips for optimizing free-tier usage to stay within API limits.

- **B_Langchain_Expanded**: Multi-Tool AI Agent
  - Expands on A_Langchain_Simple with a versatile agent using Gemini 1.5 Flash (free tier). 
  - langchain_expanded.ipynb: Google Colab notebook with an agent integrating three tools: calculator (math queries), DuckDuckGo web search (e.g., Python tutorials), and file reader (local text files). Includes memory and verbose output.
  - example.txt: Sample file for the file reader tool.
  - walkthrough.txt: Student-friendly guide explaining the code, tools, and next steps.

Future folders will include more advanced agents, such as those integrating web APIs, memory, or multi-tool workflows.
